        text="The famous and imposing statue is 38 meters tall including the plinth and is located above the city of Rio de Janeiro on Corcovado Mountain at an altitude of 710 meters.
        Inaugurated in 1931, the statue was commissioned by the Catholic Church at the beginning of the 20th century, at a time when over 90% of Brazilians were Catholic. The monument, which in Portuguese is called Christ the Redeemer, weighs 1,145 tons, and the arms of Jesus the Redeemer measure 28 meters. That is why the statue was made of reinforced concrete, being considered the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. The first sketches were made by Carlos Oswald, who also imagined Jesus Christ carrying a cross and holding a globe, standing on a pedestal that symbolized the world.
The statue was made by the French sculptor Paul Landowski, while the face of Jesus was sculpted by the Romanian Gheorghe Leonida. The total cost of the monument was $250,000, money raised from donations from Brazilians and citizens of neighboring countries."
