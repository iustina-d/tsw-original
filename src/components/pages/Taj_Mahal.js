        text="Also called the Taj Palace, the Taj Mahal temple is located in the historic city of Agra, being the most grandiose monument on the territory of India.
        The palace is famous both for its historical value and for the love story between the Mughal Emperor Khurram, nicknamed Shah Jahan, and his wife, Mumtaz Mahal.
        It is said that the emperor loved his wife so much that he built the Taj Mahal after her death as a testament to his love.
        The temple houses the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. 
        It took about 20,000 workers and 16 years to build the Taj Mahal, which was completed in 1648.
        The palace is decorated with turquoises from Tibet, agates from Yemen, sapphires from Ceylon, amethysts from Persia, coral from Arabia, jade from China,
        malachite from Russia and pearls from the Indian Ocean."
