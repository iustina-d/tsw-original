        text="Located in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, the pre-Columbian archaeological site of Chichén Itzá is famous for its massive, largely preserved pyramid at its center. Chichén Itzá is believed to have been one of the great cities of the ancient Maya civilization, which eventually became part of the Maya-Toltec civilization. It flourished until about 1200 AD, and later joined a political alliance with the cities of Mayapán and Uxmal. The Temple of Kukulkan in Chichén Itzá is a true archaeological wonder based on Mayan astronomy. It has 365 steps that signify each day of the year: there are 91 steps on each of the four sides, and the platform at the top represents the 365th step. The site is also home to a sophisticated ancient observatory that showcases the excellent advanced astronomical knowledge that the Mayan people possessed. Chichén Itzá was abandoned in the 1400s."
