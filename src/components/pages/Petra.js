        It was built by the Nabataeans, an Arab population that lived in the Wadi Musa valley for more than 400 years until they were conquered by the Roman Empire in 106 AD. Described by UNESCO as 'one of the most precious cultural properties of the cultural heritage of man', Petra has immense archaeological, historical and architectural value. In recent years, the number of tourists visiting Petra has declined due to political instability in the Middle East."
