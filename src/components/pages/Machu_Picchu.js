        text="The Inca ruins are located in the Cusco region of the Machu Picchu district (Peru), on the eastern slope of the Andes Mountains, at an altitude of 2,430 meters. Most archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was built as an estate by the Inca emperor Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui around 1450. Often mistakenly referred to as the 'Lost City of the Incas', it is the most familiar icon of the Inca civilization. The site developed as a city, but was abandoned a century later, in 1532, when it was conquered by the Spanish. The city remained largely unknown to the rest of the world until its discovery by American explorer Hiram Bingham. A newer theory suggests that Machu Picchu may have been the final stage of an ancient pilgrimage route of the Inca people. The architecture was integrated into the natural terrain, its polished rock walls and terraces. Its three main structures are the Intihuatana , the Temple of the Sun , and the Chamber of the Three Windows ."
