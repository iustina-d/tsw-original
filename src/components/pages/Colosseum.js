        text="Also known in the past as the Flavian Amphitheatre, after the family name of the emperor Vespasian, the Colosseum is the only European construction included in the list of the 7 wonders of the modern world. The construction of the amphitheater in the capital of Rome was initiated in AD 72. by Emperor Vespasian and was completed in AD 80. by his successor, Titus. Domitian, another emperor of the Flavian dynasty, later made some changes to the Colosseum. 
      In the past, the Colosseum hosted battles between gladiators, between humans and animals, as well as public executions, for four centuries. Earthquake damage and exploitation of the Colosseum's materials have meant that the current structure is only a third of the original structure. Even so, today it is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Europe ."
